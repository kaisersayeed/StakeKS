# Stock Trading App - Angular + Ionic Implementation

## Overview
This is a mobile-first stock trading application built with Angular 16+ and Ionic 7+. It features a clean, modern UI matching the provided Figma designs with real-time data integration and smooth user interactions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm start

# Navigate to http://localhost:4200
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build --prod
```

## 📱 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Features
1. **Invest/Dashboard Page**
   - Portfolio summary with total equity
   - Realized gains/losses display
   - User holdings list with current values
   - Trending stocks section

2. **Discover Page**
   - Real-time stock search with debouncing
   - Top 3 volume stocks display
   - Clean search interface

3. **Data Integration**
   - Merged pricing.json and details.json
   - Calculated metrics (change %, gains, etc.)
   - Mock portfolio positions
   - RxJS-based state management

4. **Reusable Components**
   - Stock Card component (matches Figma design)
   - Type badges (stock/etf/otc)
   - Responsive layout

5. **Design System**
   - CSS custom properties/variables
   - Consistent spacing and typography
   - Color tokens for theming

```

### Data Flow
1. DataService loads pricing.json and details.json
2. Data is merged and enriched with calculated fields
3. RxJS Observables provide reactive data streams
4. Components subscribe via async pipe
5. Changes automatically propagate through the UI

### State Management
- Service-based architecture
- RxJS BehaviorSubjects for state
- Observable streams with shareReplay for caching
- Async pipe in templates for automatic subscription management

## 🎨 Design Implementation

### Matching Figma Designs
- Stock cards with logo, price, stats, and change indicators
- Type badges with distinct colors (stock/etf/otc)
- Portfolio summary with equity and gains
- Consistent spacing using design tokens
- Clean, minimal aesthetic

### Design Tokens
```scss
--color-primary: #000000
--color-positive: #22C55E (green)
--color-negative: #EF4444 (red)
--spacing-md: 16px
--radius-md: 12px
```

## 📊 Data Models

### Stock Detail
```typescript
{
  symbol: string
  fullName: string
  currentPrice: number
  change: number
  changePercent: number
  volume: number
  marketCap: number
  type: 'stock' | 'etf' | 'otc'
}
```

### Holding Position  
```typescript
{
  symbol: string
  quantity: number
  averageCost: number
  currentValue: number
  unrealizedGain: number
  unrealizedGainPercent: number
}
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

   - Search filters by type
   - More detailed results

 **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket integration for live prices
   - Automatic portfolio refresh
   - Price change notifications

 **Performance Optimizations**
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists

### Nice to Have

## 📝 Development Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Service-based State**: Chose services with RxJS over NgRx for simplicity
2. **Mock Data**: Generated realistic portfolio positions from provided JSON
3. **Components**: Built reusable components matching Figma library

### Trade-offs Made
- Focused on core pages (Invest/Discover) and order flow
- Used simple search, did not have time to do complex filtering
- Mock data generation vs real API integration
- Minimal animations to stay within time limit
- Did not pay much attention on pixel perfect and color matching with Figma

### Known Limitations
1. No persistent storage (refresh loses state)
2. Limited error handling
3. Basic search functionality
